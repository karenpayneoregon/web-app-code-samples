# Session State

Session state is a mechanism that enables you to store and retrieve user specific values temporarily. These values can be stored for the duration of the visitor's session on your site. In most cases, they are stored in server memory, although options exist for using persistent and/or distributed storage mechanisms if, for example, you are using multiple web servers for your application (web farm etc).
