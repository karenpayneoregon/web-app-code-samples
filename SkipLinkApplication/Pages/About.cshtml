                <strong>Frank Borman - One World</strong><br/><br/>
                The view of the earth from the moon fascinated me - a small disk, 240,000 miles away. It was hard to think that that
                little thing held so many problems, so many frustrations. <br/><br/>
                Raging nationalistic interests, famines, wars,
                pestilence don't show from that distance. I'm convinced that some wayward stranger in a space-craft, coming
                from some other part of the heavens, could look at earth and never know that it was inhabited at all. But the
                same wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively that if the earth were inhabited, then the destinies of all
                who lived on it must inevitably be interwoven and joined. We are one hunk of ground, water, air, clouds, floating around in space.
                From out there it really is 'one world'.
